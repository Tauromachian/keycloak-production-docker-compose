# Keycloak docker compose file

This is a simple docker-compose file to install Keycloak for production.

### Remember

You need to set the environment variables for this to work properly.
The .env.example contains the variables I am using. Copy it and remove the .example.
Remember to also set the KEYCLOAK_URL variable to your host's name.
